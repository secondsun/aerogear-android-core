# AeroGear Android Core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-android-core.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-android-core)

AeroGear's Android libraries were built as jar and aar packages using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and the [android-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin). The project follows the standard Maven layout so it can be imported directly into most IDEs as a Maven project.

## Core

The core library contains common components and interfaces which the rest of the AeroGear Android libraries depend on.
